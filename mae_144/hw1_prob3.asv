%program a c2d by pole-sero mapping (a.k.a matched z-transform)
%step 1 (transform s to z via z=e^(sh))

%function [bz, az] = MBG_C2D_matched(bs, as, h, omegab)
%syms as bs 
[bs]=[3];
[as]=[-1 -2];
h = 1;

bl = length(bs);
al = length(as);

if al > bl
    l = al;
end



%step 2 (map all infinite zeros of D(s) to z=-1 in D(z)

%step 3 (match gain of D(z) at z = e^(iwh) with gain of D(s) at s = iw, w =
%0)
